# Progressive Web App Implementation for Pre-Purchase Inspection Application

## Overview
This pull request implements a Progressive Web App (PWA) for the Canadian Buyer Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI) application. The PWA enables users to perform comprehensive vehicle inspections with full offline capabilities, improving usability in various real-world scenarios such as inspection locations with limited or no connectivity.

## Key Features
- **Full Offline Support**: Implemented service worker caching strategy to enable complete offline functionality
- **Installable Application**: Added proper manifest and installation logic to make the app installable on mobile and desktop devices
- **Offline Data Storage**: Implemented IndexedDB (using Dexie.js) for local storage of inspection data
- **PWA Status Components**: Added user interface elements to show connectivity status and PWA installation options
- **Development Environment**: Created a robust development environment with SSL certificate generation for PWA testing
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for PWA development, offline testing, and troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation
- Used Vite PWA Plugin for streamlined PWA configuration
- Created custom service worker configuration for optimal caching strategies
- Implemented proper MIME type handling for service worker files
- Added utility functions for checking service worker status, offline capability, and PWA installation
- Set up SSL certificate generation scripts for HTTPS testing on local networks

## Testing Instructions
1. **Localhost Testing (Easiest)**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-pwa-localhost.sh
   # or
   cd app && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Local Network Testing with HTTPS**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-pwa.sh
   # or
   cd app && npm run dev:mobile:https
   ```

3. **Offline Testing**:
   - Load the application completely while connected
   - Use Chrome DevTools to simulate offline mode or physically disconnect from the network
   - Verify that the application still functions correctly

## Documentation
Added several documentation files to support development and testing:
- `PWA_DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md`: Setup instructions for PWA development
- `PWA_OFFLINE_TESTING.md`: Guide for testing offline capabilities
- `SSL_CERTIFICATE_ISSUES.md`: Solutions for certificate-related issues
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_SERVICE_WORKERS.md`: Common issues and solutions

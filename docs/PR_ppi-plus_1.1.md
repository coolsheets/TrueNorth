# Pull Request: PPI+ Branch

## Overview
This PR enhances the TrueNorth application with comprehensive PWA (Progressive Web Application) features, offline functionality, and server-side optimizations. The primary focus is on enabling a robust offline-first experience for vehicle inspections in the field, where internet connectivity may be unreliable.

## Key Changes

### PWA Enhancements
- Implemented full PWA support with service worker for offline functionality
- Added manifest files and new icon assets for better mobile installation experience
- Created offline detection and synchronization utilities
- Added visual indicators for offline status and sync operations

### Server Optimizations
- Migrated server-side code from TypeScript to JavaScript for simplified maintenance
- Enhanced API endpoints for inspection data synchronization
- Improved error handling and validation

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added SyncIndicator component to show real-time sync status
- Redesigned Logo component with better responsive behavior
- Enhanced OfflineBadge with more detailed connectivity information
- Improved PDF export functionality for inspection reports

### Documentation
- Added detailed OFFLINE_TESTING.md guide for testing PWA features
- Updated README.md with SSL certificate setup for local PWA testing
- Documented new offline workflow in various components

### Development & Build Pipeline
- Updated tsconfig files for better type safety
- Added specific build configurations for service worker
- Enhanced Vite configuration for PWA support
- Updated package dependencies to latest versions

## Testing Instructions
1. Follow the updated README.md instructions for setting up HTTPS for local development
2. Use the `npm run dev:mobile` script to test on mobile devices
3. Test the offline functionality by disconnecting from the internet after initial load
4. Verify data synchronization when reconnecting to the internet
5. Test the PWA installation on mobile devices

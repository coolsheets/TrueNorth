# GitHub Pages Workflow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dependency Caching Error**
   - Removed the specific cache-dependency-path parameter which was causing resolution issues
   - Updated to use root-level dependencies for caching

2. **Workflow Structure**
   - Changed from multi-line commands to individual steps with `working-directory` for clarity
   - Added file existence verification before deployment
   - Added detailed error reporting and build output validation

3. **Deployment Action**
   - Added commit message for skip CI to prevent deployment loops
   - Added token specification to ensure proper permissions

4. **PWA-Specific Workflow**
   - Created a separate dedicated workflow file for PWA deployment
   - Uses the simpler `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action for more reliable deployment
   - Only runs when changes are made to the app directory

5. **Path Configuration**
   - Updated manifest and icon paths in index.html to use relative paths
   - Ensured vite.config.ts uses correct base path for GitHub Pages

## How to Use the Workflows

### For General Deployment
The `deploy-gh-pages.yml` workflow will deploy the full application when changes are pushed to main branches or when manually triggered.

### For PWA-Specific Updates
The `deploy-pwa.yml` workflow is optimized for PWA changes and will deploy just the app when changes are made to the app directory.

## If Issues Persist

If deployment still fails, try these steps:

1. Run the workflow manually with the "workflow_dispatch" trigger
2. Check the build output directory to ensure all files are present
3. Try the simplified PWA-specific workflow
4. Verify that GitHub Pages is enabled in the repository settings

### Dependency Installation Issues

We've updated the workflows to install dependencies for all parts of the project:
- Root dependencies using `npm ci`
- App-specific dependencies in `/app` directory
- Server dependencies in `/server` directory

For local testing, you can use:
- `npm run setup` - Runs the setup-dependencies.sh script
- `npm run install:all` - Installs dependencies in all directories

Remember that GitHub Pages may take a few minutes to reflect the changes after a successful deployment.
